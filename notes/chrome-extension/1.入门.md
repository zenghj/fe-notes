## background.js
>The background script is the extension's event handler; it contains listeners for browser events that are important to the extension. It lies dormant until an event is fired then performs the instructed logic. An effective background script is only loaded when it is needed and unloaded when it goes idle.

### Background Script

### Content scripts
>Extensions that read or write to web pages utilize a content script. The content script contains JavaScript that executes in the contexts of a page that has been loaded into the browser. Content scripts read and modify the DOM of web pages the browser visits.

Content scripts可以直接操作正在访问页面中的Dom元素

Content scripts can communicate with their parent extension by exchanging messages and storing values using the storage API.

## Using Chrome APIs
In addition to having access to the same APIs as web pages, extensions can also use extension-specific APIs that create tight integration with the browser.
